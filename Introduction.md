**= About me =**

I'm just a 19 years old that loves information technology and the lower levels of its mechanics; i also love IT Security.
You can find something more on my official website.

**== Introduction ==**

This project is born to let you know how ElSword's KoG Team developed the game and how it is structured, moreover, you can easily modify every LUA module and ESS locale file (if you want to modify the translations).
It's easy to use and fast!

**=== Why i did this ===**

Pure training for my reverse engineering and coding skills.
Plus i was curious about opening an Open Source project.
